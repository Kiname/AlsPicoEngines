Once you have copied this folder to your Raspberry Pi you will need to type this command:
 
./addfiles2     
 
(This will copy all required files to /opt/picochess/engines/armv7l, preserve your current engines.ini to engines.ini.save.adapt, create a new engines.ini to include the latest Adapt engines & reboot your system) 
 
 
Have fun, 
 
Al.
